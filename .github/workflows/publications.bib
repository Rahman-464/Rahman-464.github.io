abstract = {This study investigates the microstructural transformations and associated property enhancements in a Zr50-Ti50 alloy annealed at only 120 °C with low duty cycle current pulses. Microanalysis with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) show the formation of alpha lath structure, typically observed in much higher thermal annealing temperatures. EBSD and XRD analyses revealed the formation and/or growth of the lath structure, with notable changes in pole distributions and the appearance of a distinct peak at 52.5° in the XRD spectrum. The lath structure is quantified using FiJi weka segmentation machine learning technique. Nanoindentation data showed an increase in the average hardness from ∼7 to ∼8 GPa and a corresponding increment in the reduced modulus from 127 to 148 GPa. The observed increase in low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) from 4% to 12% further complements the findings, suggesting a complex interplay of microstructural features contributing to the overall improvement in the mechanical properties. The proposed low temperature annealing technique demonstrates the predominant role of the electron wind force for tailoring the microstructure and mechanical performance of ZrTi alloys, providing insights that could have implications for the broader field of materials engineering.},

abstract = {Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) accommodate residual stress through the rearrangement and accumulation of dislocations during cold rolling. This study presents an electron wind force-based annealing approach to recover cold-rolling induced residual stress in FeCrAl alloy below 100 °C in 1 min. This is significantly lower than conventional thermal annealing, which typically requires temperatures around 750 °C for about 1.5 h. A key feature of our approach is the athermal electron wind force effect, which promotes dislocation movement and stress relief at significantly lower temperatures. The electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis reveals that the concentration of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) is reduced from 82.4% in the cold-rolled state to a mere 47.5% following electropulsing. This level of defect recovery even surpasses the pristine material's initial state, which exhibited 54.8% LAGBs. This reduction in LAGB concentration was complemented by kernel average misorientation (KAM) maps and X-ray diffraction (XRD) Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) measurements, which further validated the microstructural enhancements. Nanoindentation tests revealed a slight increase in hardness despite the reduction in dislocation density, suggesting a balance between grain boundary refinement and dislocation dynamics. This proposed low-temperature technique, driven by athermal electron wind forces, presents a promising avenue for residual stress mitigation while minimizing undesirable thermal effects, paving the way for advancements in various material processing applications.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of combined thermal and athermal stimuli in mitigating the extremely high-density nature of dislocation networks in the form of low-angle grain boundaries in FeCrAl alloy. Electron wind force, generated from very low duty cycle and high current density pulses, was used as the athermal stimulus. The electron wind force stimulus alone was unable to remove the residual stress (80% low-angle grain boundaries) due to cold rolling to 25% thickness reduction. When the duty cycle was increased to allow average temperature of 100 °C, the specimen could be effectively annealed in 1 min at a current density of 3300 A/mm2. In comparison, conventional thermal annealing requires at least 750 °C and 1.5 h. For specimens with 50% thickness reduction (85% low-angle grain boundaries), the electron wind force was again unable to anneal the defects even at 3300 A/mm2 current density and average temperature of 100 °C. Intriguingly, allowing average concurrent temperature of 200 °C eliminated almost all the low-angle grain boundaries at a current density of 700 A/mm2, even lower than that required for the 25% thickness reduced specimens. Comprehensive electron and X-ray diffraction evidence show that alloys with extremely high defect density can be effectively annealed in less than a minute at approximately 200 °C, offering a substantial improvement over conventional high-temperature annealing.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to control the microstructure of materials, such as annealing, require high temperature treatment for long periods of time. In this study, we present a room temperature microstructure manipulation method by using the mechanical momentum of electrical current pulses. In particular, a short burst of high-density current pulses with low duty cycle is applied to an annealed FeCrAl alloy, and the corresponding response of microstructure is captured by using Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) analysis. We show evidence of controllable changes in grain orientation at specimen temperature below 28 C. To demonstrate such microstructural control, we apply the current pulses in two perpendicular directions and observe the corresponding grain rotation. Up to 18 of grain rotation was observed, which could be reversed by varying the electropulsing direction. Detailed analysis at the grain level reveals that electropulsing in a specific direction induces clockwise rotation from their pristine state, while subsequent cross-perpendicular electropulsing results in an anticlockwise rotation. In addition, our proposed room temperature processing yields notable grain refinement, while the average misorientation and density of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) remain unaltered. The findings of this study highlight the potentials of 'convective diffusion' in electrical current based materials processing science towards microstructural control at room temperature.},

abstract = {Semiconductor devices contain defects and localized mechanical stress even in their pristine states, persisting after post-fabrication annealing. We hypothesize that these pre-existing conditions, with their lower threshold energy for defect proliferation and/or ionization, may serve as nuclei for radiation damage. To test this hypothesis, we adopted a two-pronged approach: (a) performing electron wind force (EWF) annealing preemptively on pristine Zener diodes to eliminate pre-existing defects before radiation exposure, and (b) applying EWF annealing restoratively on devices already damaged by radiation. The EWF process is non-thermal and can eliminate defects below 30 °C that persist through conventional thermal annealing. Both pristine and EWF-annealed pristine devices were exposed to 15 MeV protons with a fluence of 1014 cm−2. Radiation damage increased the ideality factor from 1 to 2.33 in the pristine devices, while the preemptively EWF-annealed devices showed remarkable resilience, with an ideality factor of 1.5. Similar performance improvements were observed with restorative EWF annealing on radiation-damaged devices. This resilience and recovery in performance are further supported by Raman spectroscopy indicating enhanced crystallinity compared to the pristine condition. These findings demonstrate the potential of EWF annealing as both a protective and restorative treatment for semiconductor devices in high-radiation environments.},

In this study, we introduce electron wind force (EWF)-assisted annealing as an alternative approach to mitigate irradiation-induced defects at significantly lower temperatures. FeCrAl samples irradiated with 5 MeV Zr(2+) ions at a dose of 10(14) cm(-2) were annealed using EWF at 250 °C for 60 s. We demonstrate a remarkable transformation in the irradiated microstructure, where significant increases in kernel average misorientation (KAM) and low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) typically indicate heightened defect density; the use of EWF annealing reversed these effects. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed these findings, showing substantial reductions in full width at half maximum (FWHM) values and a realignment of peak positions toward their original states, indicative of stress and defect recovery. To compare the effectiveness of EWF, we also conducted traditional thermal annealing at 250 °C for 7 h, which proved less effective in defect recovery as evidenced by less pronounced improvements in XRD FWHM values.},

abstract = {Thermal annealing is commonly used in fabrication processing and/or performance enhancement of electronic and opto-electronic devices. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach, where high current density pulses are used instead of high temperature. The basic premise is that the electron wind force, resulting from the momentum loss of high-energy electrons at defect sites, is capable of mobilizing internal defects. The proposed technique is demonstrated on commercially available optoelectronic devices with two different initial conditions. The first study involved a thermally degraded edge-emitting laser diode. About 90% of the resulting increase in forward current was mitigated by the proposed annealing technique where very low duty cycle was used to suppress any temperature rise. The second study was more challenging, where a pristine vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) was subjected to similar processing to see if the technique can enhance performance. Encouragingly, this treatment yielded a notable improvement of over 20% in the forward current. These findings underscore the potential of electropulsing as an efficient in-operando technique for damage recovery and performance enhancement in optoelectronic devices.},

The power figure-of-merits VB 2/RON where RON is the on-resistance were 0.31 MW{\textperiodcentered}cm−2 for HJD and 0.16 MW{\textperiodcentered}cm−2 for SBD. The lowest turn-on voltages were ∼2.03 and 1.91 V for HJDs and SBDs, respectively, with ON/OFF ratios up to 102. The maximum field before breakdown was 0.45 MV{\textperiodcentered}cm−1 in HJDs and 0.31 MV{\textperiodcentered}cm−1 in SBDs. These correspond to <3% of the critical field in AlN of ∼15 MV{\textperiodcentered}cm−1. This work demonstrates there is still significant optimization to be done in the overall quality of the AlN, including purity, crystal perfection, and defect density to realize the potential of this material as an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for efficient multi-kV power switching applications.

The Euler equilibrium equations and the associated boundary conditions are obtained via the variational principle and iterative integration by parts. In particular, we formulate the complete expressions of Piola-type triple stress and its coupled triple force arising in the third gradient of continuum deformations, which, in turn, yield the unique deformation maps in the presence of admissible boundary conditions of higher order. The solutions of the resulting systems of differential equations are obtained via the custom-built numerical scheme from which smooth and dilatational shear angle distributions are predicted throughout the entire domain of interest. It is also observed that the third gradient constitutive parameter is associated with the volume dilatation of third-gradient continua, which may be appeared in the form of shear band inclination angle.},
