abstract = {In this study, we explore the rejuvenation of a Zener diode degraded by high electrical stress, leading to a leftward shift, and broadening of the Zener breakdown voltage knee, alongside a 57% reduction in forward current. We employed a non-thermal annealing method involving high-density electric pulses with short pulse width and low frequency. The annealing process took <30 s at near-ambient temperature. Raman spectroscopy supports the electrical characterization, showing enhancement in crystallinity to explain the restoration of the breakdown knee followed by improvement in forward current by ∼85%.},

abstract = {Semiconductor devices contain defects and localized mechanical stress even in their pristine states, persisting after post-fabrication annealing. We hypothesize that these pre-existing conditions, with their lower threshold energy for defect proliferation and/or ionization, may serve as nuclei for radiation damage. To test this hypothesis, we adopted a two-pronged approach: (a) performing electron wind force (EWF) annealing preemptively on pristine Zener diodes to eliminate pre-existing defects before radiation exposure, and (b) applying EWF annealing restoratively on devices already damaged by radiation. The EWF process is non-thermal and can eliminate defects below 30 °C that persist through conventional thermal annealing. Both pristine and EWF-annealed pristine devices were exposed to 15 MeV protons with a fluence of 1014 cm−2. Radiation damage increased the ideality factor from 1 to 2.33 in the pristine devices, while the preemptively EWF-annealed devices showed remarkable resilience, with an ideality factor of 1.5. Similar performance improvements were observed with restorative EWF annealing on radiation-damaged devices. This resilience and recovery in performance are further supported by Raman spectroscopy indicating enhanced crystallinity compared to the pristine condition. These findings demonstrate the potential of EWF annealing as both a protective and restorative treatment for semiconductor devices in high-radiation environments.},

abstract = {Thermal annealing is commonly used in fabrication processing and/or performance enhancement of electronic and opto-electronic devices. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach, where high current density pulses are used instead of high temperature. The basic premise is that the electron wind force, resulting from the momentum loss of high-energy electrons at defect sites, is capable of mobilizing internal defects. The proposed technique is demonstrated on commercially available optoelectronic devices with two different initial conditions. The first study involved a thermally degraded edge-emitting laser diode. About 90% of the resulting increase in forward current was mitigated by the proposed annealing technique where very low duty cycle was used to suppress any temperature rise. The second study was more challenging, where a pristine vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) was subjected to similar processing to see if the technique can enhance performance. Encouragingly, this treatment yielded a notable improvement of over 20% in the forward current. These findings underscore the potential of electropulsing as an efficient in-operando technique for damage recovery and performance enhancement in optoelectronic devices.},
