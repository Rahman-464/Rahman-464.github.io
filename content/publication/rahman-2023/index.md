abstract: The mechanics of fiber-reinforced composite materials is presented within
  the framework of the second strain gradient theory. As such, a continuum-based model
  is developed for the analysis of elastic materials reinforced with bidirectional
  fibers and subjected to finite plane deformations. The obtained model is subsequently
  applied to the cases of the unidirectional fiber composites for the purpose of model
  implementation. The Euler equilibrium equations and the associated boundary conditions
  are obtained via the variational principle and iterative integration by parts. In
  particular, we formulate the complete expressions of Piola-type triple stress and
  its coupled triple force arising in the third gradient of continuum deformations,
  which, in turn, yield the unique deformation maps in the presence of admissible
  boundary conditions of higher order. The solutions of the resulting systems of differential
  equations are obtained via the custom-built numerical scheme from which smooth and
  dilatational shear angle distributions are predicted throughout the entire domain
  of interest. It is also observed that the third gradient constitutive parameter
  is associated with the volume dilatation of third-gradient continua, which may be
  appeared in the form of shear band inclination angle.
