abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of combined thermal and athermal
  stimuli in mitigating the extremely high-density nature of dislocation networks
  in the form of low-angle grain boundaries in FeCrAl alloy. Electron wind force,
  generated from very low duty cycle and high current density pulses, was used as
  the athermal stimulus. The electron wind force stimulus alone was unable to remove
  the residual stress (80% low-angle grain boundaries) due to cold rolling to 25%
  thickness reduction. When the duty cycle was increased to allow average temperature
  of 100 °C, the specimen could be effectively annealed in 1 min at a current density
  of 3300 A/mm2. In comparison, conventional thermal annealing requires at least 750
  °C and 1.5 h. For specimens with 50% thickness reduction (85% low-angle grain boundaries),
  the electron wind force was again unable to anneal the defects even at 3300 A/mm2
  current density and average temperature of 100 °C. Intriguingly, allowing average
  concurrent temperature of 200 °C eliminated almost all the low-angle grain boundaries
  at a current density of 700 A/mm2, even lower than that required for the 25% thickness
  reduced specimens. Comprehensive electron and X-ray diffraction evidence show that
  alloys with extremely high defect density can be effectively annealed in less than
  a minute at approximately 200 °C, offering a substantial improvement over conventional
  high-temperature annealing.
