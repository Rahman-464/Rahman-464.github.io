abstract: Traditional defect recovery methods rely on high-temperature annealing,
  often  exceeding 750 °C for FeCrAl. In this study, we introduce electron wind force
  (EWF)-assisted annealing as an alternative approach to mitigate irradiation-induced
  defects at significantly lower temperatures. FeCrAl samples irradiated with 5 MeV
  Zr(2+) ions at a dose of 10(14) cm(-2) were annealed using EWF at 250 °C for 60
  s. We demonstrate a remarkable transformation in the irradiated microstructure,
  where significant increases in kernel average misorientation (KAM) and low-angle
  grain boundaries (LAGBs) typically indicate heightened defect density; the use of
  EWF annealing reversed these effects. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed these findings,
  showing substantial reductions in full width at half maximum (FWHM) values and a
  realignment of peak positions toward their original states, indicative of stress
  and defect recovery. To compare the effectiveness of EWF, we also conducted traditional
  thermal annealing at 250 °C for 7 h, which proved less effective in defect recovery
  as evidenced by less pronounced improvements in XRD FWHM values.
