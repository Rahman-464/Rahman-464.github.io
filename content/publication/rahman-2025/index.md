abstract: Pre-existing defects in semiconductor devices can act as nucleation sites
  for radiation damage. Defects generated from mismatches in lattice constant, stiffness
  and thermal expansion are difficult to eliminate with thermal annealing. We propose
  a non-thermal stimulus, the electron wind force, to reduce the pre-existing defect
  concentration in Zener diodes at room temperature in a minute. The pristine and
  pre-annealed diodes were exposed to 11 MeV Au3+ ions at different fluences to induce
  damage levels of 0.2, 2, 10 and 20 displacement per atom (dpa). Post irradiation
  characterization showed up to 10 times improvement in radiation tolerance in the
  pre-annealed devices.
