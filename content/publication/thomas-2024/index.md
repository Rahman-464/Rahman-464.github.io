abstract: The combined effects of high-temperature and heavy-ion irradiation on Mrozowski
  cracks (MC) and nuclear graphite crystallographic dimensions have been studied using
  in situ heating and in situ ion-irradiation in the transmission electron microscope
  (TEM). Electron transparent lamella of nuclear graphite, IG-110, was irradiated
  using a 2.8 MeV Au beam at an ion flux of 3.991 ×1010 ion cm−2 s−1 for 70 min at
  800 °C. Upon high-temperature irradiation, Mrozowski crack closure was studied quantitatively.
  The analysis showed linear, positive expansion of nuclear graphite which is significantly
  different from the dimensional changes previously reported for low-dose neutron
  irradiation of nuclear graphite in which the material undergoes negative to positive
  expansion via a turnaround radiation dose. The trend of the thermal expansion coefficient
  (CTE) of pristine IG-110 in this study is consistent with previous reports in the
  100 °C–800 °C temperature region in which the dimensional change ranges from negative
  to positive values.
