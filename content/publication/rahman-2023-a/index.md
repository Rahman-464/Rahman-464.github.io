abstract: A continuum model is formulated to obtain the mechanical response of an
  elastic solid reinforced with randomly distributed nanofibers. The kinematics of
  embedded nanofibers are formulated by incorporating the shear lag parameter and
  Krenchel Orientation factor into the second strain-gradient model. The Euler equilibrium
  equations and associated boundary conditions are obtained by means of variational
  principles and iterated integration by parts. In particular, we obtain the rate
  of change in curvature via the computation of third gradient of deformations, and
  this results in an additional set of boundary conditions from which the expressions
  of Piola-type triple stress and its coupled triple forces are formulated. The numerical
  solutions of the resulting systems of nonlinear coupled differential equations are
  obtained via the custom-built finite element analysis scheme. Finally, we simulate
  the uniaxial extension test with respect to various fiber aspect ratios and triple
  stress parameters to obtain the mechanical response of the nanofiber composite system.
  It is observed that, among other interesting features, the fiber aspect ratio and
  the third gradient constitutive parameter are related to the effective Young's modulus
  of the third gradient continua.
