abstract: Traditional approaches to control the microstructure of materials, such
  as annealing, require high temperature treatment for long periods of time. In this
  study, we present a room temperature microstructure manipulation method by using
  the mechanical momentum of electrical current pulses. In particular, a short burst
  of high-density current pulses with low duty cycle is applied to an annealed FeCrAl
  alloy, and the corresponding response of microstructure is captured by using Electron
  Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) analysis. We show evidence of controllable changes
  in grain orientation at specimen temperature below 28 C. To demonstrate such microstructural
  control, we apply the current pulses in two perpendicular directions and observe
  the corresponding grain rotation. Up to 18 of grain rotation was observed, which
  could be reversed by varying the electropulsing direction. Detailed analysis at
  the grain level reveals that electropulsing in a specific direction induces clockwise
  rotation from their pristine state, while subsequent cross-perpendicular electropulsing
  results in an anticlockwise rotation. In addition, our proposed room temperature
  processing yields notable grain refinement, while the average misorientation and
  density of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) remain unaltered. The findings of
  this study highlight the potentials of 'convective diffusion' in electrical current
  based materials processing science towards microstructural control at room temperature.
