 abstract = {Polycrystalline graphite contains multi-scale defects, which are difficult to anneal thermally because of the extremely high temperatures involved in the manufacturing process. In this study, we demonstrate annealing of nuclear graphite NBG-18 at temperatures below 28 Â°C, exploiting the electron wind force, a non-thermal stimulus. High current density pulses were passed through the specimens with a very low-duty cycle so that the electron momentum could mobilize the defects without heating the specimen. The effectiveness of this technique is presented with a significant decrease in electrical resistivity, defect counts from X-ray computed tomography, Raman spectroscopy, and nanoindentation-based mechanical characterization. Such multi-modal evidence highlights the feasibility of nanoscale defect control at temperatures about two orders of magnitude below the graphitization temperature.},
