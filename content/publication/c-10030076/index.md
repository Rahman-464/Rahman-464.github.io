abstract: Polycrystalline graphite contains multi-scale defects, which are difficult
  to anneal thermally because of the extremely high temperatures involved in the manufacturing
  process. In this study, we demonstrate annealing of nuclear graphite NBG-18 at temperatures
  below 28 Â°C, exploiting the electron wind force, a non-thermal stimulus. High current
  density pulses were passed through the specimens with a very low-duty cycle so that
  the electron momentum could mobilize the defects without heating the specimen. The
  effectiveness of this technique is presented with a significant decrease in electrical
  resistivity, defect counts from X-ray computed tomography, Raman spectroscopy, and
  nanoindentation-based mechanical characterization. Such multi-modal evidence highlights
  the feasibility of nanoscale defect control at temperatures about two orders of
  magnitude below the graphitization temperature.
