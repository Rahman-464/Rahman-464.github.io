abstract: Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) accommodate residual stress through the
  rearrangement and accumulation of dislocations during cold rolling. This study presents
  an electron wind force-based annealing approach to recover cold-rolling induced
  residual stress in FeCrAl alloy below 100 °C in 1 min. This is significantly lower
  than conventional thermal annealing, which typically requires temperatures around
  750 °C for about 1.5 h. A key feature of our approach is the athermal electron wind
  force effect, which promotes dislocation movement and stress relief at significantly
  lower temperatures. The electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis reveals
  that the concentration of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) is reduced from 82.4%
  in the cold-rolled state to a mere 47.5% following electropulsing. This level of
  defect recovery even surpasses the pristine material's initial state, which exhibited
  54.8% LAGBs. This reduction in LAGB concentration was complemented by kernel average
  misorientation (KAM) maps and X-ray diffraction (XRD) Full Width at Half Maximum
  (FWHM) measurements, which further validated the microstructural enhancements. Nanoindentation
  tests revealed a slight increase in hardness despite the reduction in dislocation
  density, suggesting a balance between grain boundary refinement and dislocation
  dynamics. This proposed low-temperature technique, driven by athermal electron wind
  forces, presents a promising avenue for residual stress mitigation while minimizing
  undesirable thermal effects, paving the way for advancements in various material
  processing applications.
