abstract: This study investigates the microstructural transformations and associated
  property enhancements in a Zr50-Ti50 alloy annealed at only 120 °C with low duty
  cycle current pulses. Microanalysis with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
  and X-ray diffraction (XRD) show the formation of alpha lath structure, typically
  observed in much higher thermal annealing temperatures. EBSD and XRD analyses revealed
  the formation and/or growth of the lath structure, with notable changes in pole
  distributions and the appearance of a distinct peak at 52.5° in the XRD spectrum.
  The lath structure is quantified using FiJi weka segmentation machine learning technique.
  Nanoindentation data showed an increase in the average hardness from ∼7 to ∼8 GPa
  and a corresponding increment in the reduced modulus from 127 to 148 GPa. The observed
  increase in low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) from 4% to 12% further complements
  the findings, suggesting a complex interplay of microstructural features contributing
  to the overall improvement in the mechanical properties. The proposed low temperature
  annealing technique demonstrates the predominant role of the electron wind force
  for tailoring the microstructure and mechanical performance of ZrTi alloys, providing
  insights that could have implications for the broader field of materials engineering.
