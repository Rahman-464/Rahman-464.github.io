 abstract = {This study investigates the microstructural transformations and associated property enhancements in a Zr50-Ti50 alloy annealed at only 120 °C with low duty cycle current pulses. Microanalysis with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) show the formation of alpha lath structure, typically observed in much higher thermal annealing temperatures. EBSD and XRD analyses revealed the formation and/or growth of the lath structure, with notable changes in pole distributions and the appearance of a distinct peak at 52.5° in the XRD spectrum. The lath structure is quantified using FiJi weka segmentation machine learning technique. Nanoindentation data showed an increase in the average hardness from ∼7 to ∼8 GPa and a corresponding increment in the reduced modulus from 127 to 148 GPa. The observed increase in low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) from 4% to 12% further complements the findings, suggesting a complex interplay of microstructural features contributing to the overall improvement in the mechanical properties. The proposed low temperature annealing technique demonstrates the predominant role of the electron wind force for tailoring the microstructure and mechanical performance of ZrTi alloys, providing insights that could have implications for the broader field of materials engineering.},
