abstract: Lateral NiO/AIN heterojunction diodes (HJDs) with breakdown voltage up to
  11.6 kV and Ni/Au/AlN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) with VB of 8.6 kV were fabricated
  on layers grown on sapphire substrates by metalorganic chemical vapor phase deposition.
  The power figure-of-merits VB 2/RON where RON is the on-resistance were 0.31 MW˙cm−2
  for HJD and 0.16 MW˙cm−2 for SBD. The lowest turn-on voltages were ∼2.03 and 1.91
  V for HJDs and SBDs, respectively, with ON/OFF ratios up to 102. The maximum field
  before breakdown was 0.45 MV˙cm−1 in HJDs and 0.31 MV˙cm−1 in SBDs. These correspond
  to <3% of the critical field in AlN of ∼15 MV˙cm−1. This work demonstrates there
  is still significant optimization to be done in the overall quality of the AlN,
  including purity, crystal perfection, and defect density to realize the potential
  of this material as an ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor for efficient multi-kV power
  switching applications. Our results also demonstrate the promise of NiO as a p-type
  conducting oxide for forming heterojunctions with AlN.
