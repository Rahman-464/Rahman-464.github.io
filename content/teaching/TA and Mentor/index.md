### **Mentorship Philosophy**
> ‚ÄúMentorship is not just about training researchers; it‚Äôs about cultivating curiosity and independence.  
> I strive to empower students to think critically, innovate confidently, and communicate their science effectively.‚Äù

## üìö Teaching Philosophy

> ‚ÄúAs an instructor, my goal is to merge theory and practice ‚Äî enabling students to visualize mechanics not as abstract equations,  
> but as living principles that govern design, function, and innovation. I believe in interactive, feedback-driven learning  
> where students grow both technically and intellectually.‚Äù
