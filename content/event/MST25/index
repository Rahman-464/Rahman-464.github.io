summary: I have presented my research on enhancing radiation resilience of Wide-Bandgap (WBG) Semiconductors and Alloys via Electron Wind Force Annealing.
abstract: Mitigating defects induced by ionizing radiation is critical for ensuring reliability in electronic devices, particularly those based on wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors for space and nuclear applications. Conventional defect mitigation methods involve material design optimization, radiation shielding, redundancy, or thermal annealing; however, these approaches often impose constraints such as performance trade-offs, complex implementation, or thermal degradation due to thermoelastic strain. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Electron Wind Force (EWF) annealing -a rapid, non-thermal technique performed at near room temperature within seconds. In our studies, EWF effectively rejuvenated radiation-damaged WBG semiconductor devices, repeatedly restoring their electrical characteristics beyond traditional methods. Additionally, we extended this technique successfully to mitigate defects in metal alloys, highlighting EWFâ€™s versatility. Due to its efficiency, simplicity, and in-operando compatibility, EWF annealing emerges as a promising strategy for defect mitigation across diverse materials, significantly enhancing device resilience in radiation-rich environments.
