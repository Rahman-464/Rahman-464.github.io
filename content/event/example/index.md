summary: I have presented my research on low-temperature annealing of cold rolled FeCrAl alloy.
abstract: 'Controlling the microstructure and defects of materials through
traditional
methods like thermal annealing, which involves high temperatures and long
processing times, often introduces additional challenges, such as
thermoelastic
strain and increased energy consumption. This necessitates exploring
alternative techniques that can modify material properties without the
drawbacks of conventional thermal treatments. The Electron Wind Force (EWF)

could be such an athermal stimulus, which originates from the momentum
transfer
between the electron and lattice atoms.  We observe that the Electron Wind
Force (EWF) can effectively control grain orientation and modify the
microstructure of various alloys. In addition, we will also discuss how the
EWF
can eliminate defects induced by cold rolling in a FeCrAl alloy in less
than a
minute at temperatures below 100°C, which typically require temperatures of

750°C and durations of up to 1.5 hours with traditional annealing. Also,
EWF
rejuvenates the performance of semiconductor devices and lowers radiation
damage.
