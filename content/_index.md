abstract: Conventional annealing of high-entropy alloys relies on elevated temperatures
  to promote defect recovery and microstructural refinement, but such treatments are
  slow, composition-dependent, and often lead to uncontrolled grain growth. In this
  study, we explore electron wind force (EWF) as a low temperature, athermal route
  to rapid defect mitigation in a CuCoNiFeCr system. Using in-situ transmission electron
  microscopy, we directly tracked the same microstructural region while increasing
  EWF magnitude. Our observations revealed a progressive reduction in defect density.
  Short duration (40 µs), low frequency (2 Hz), low-current (0.1 A) pulses mitigated
  most of the mobile defects in 5 min. Increasing current amplitude drove extensive
  defect migration, with limited grain growth. Ex-situ annealing of bulk HEA corroborated
  these findings, showing a ∼26.8 % decrease in electrical resistance and a ∼12.5
  % reduction in hardness, consistent with dislocation annihilation and structural
  relaxation. Similar recovery trends observed in aluminum confirm the generality
  of the approach.
