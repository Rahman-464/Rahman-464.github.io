      My PhD research focuses on developing a low-temperature alternative to conventional thermal annealing using Electron Wind Force (EWF) annealing. This technique enables efficient defect recovery in radiation-damaged semiconductors and mechanically deformed metal alloys, significantly reducing energy consumption and processing time.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
